        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Child Elements refer to elements nested inside other elements.</li>
          <li>Parent Elements refer to elements that house all the child elements.</li>
          <li>"div" element can be used to create a division in a page.</li>
          <li>"span" element can be used to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>"h1", "h2", "h3", etc. elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>"p" element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>"ul" element represents unordered lists or bullet points.</li>
          <li>"ol" element represents ordered lists or numbered points.</li>
          <li>"li" element represents list items.</li>
          <li>"img" element contains information about images that are displayed on webpages.</li>
          <li>"src=" attribute defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>"br" element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>inline CSS refers to style an element directly in the HTML file; applies to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule.</li>
            <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
            <li>external CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file making design changes easier.</li>
            <li>when using external style sheet, you must link the file using a "link" element placed in the HTML "head" element</li>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations apply</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property ex. property is color and the value for the property is blue</li>
            <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, which allows for declarations to affect both selectors</li>
            <li>"text-align:" is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage</li>
            <li>the "display" property assigned with the "block" value to assign each image to start on a new line</li>
            <li>"font-size:" will adjust the font size of the element</li>
            <li>".card" designates this as a class selector, therefore any HTML element assigned to this class "card" will gain these properties</li>
            <li>"width:" of the element at "?%" of the available width</li>
            <li>"margin:" property assigns a "?px" to the top and bottom; "auto" value to the left and right</li>
            <li>"border:" property assigns a border with a width of "?px" solid and a color value</li>
            <li>"box-shadow:" CSS property adds shadow effects around an elements frame; "?px" value of X axis and "?px" value of Y axis followed by defining a color value</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>"git status": checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>"git checkout -b branch-name": creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>"git add -A": stages our data changes.</li>
          <li>"git commit -m "your message here": commits the data locally with a descriptive message of changes made.</li>
          <li>"git pull origin main": pulls the base branch "main" to our feature branch.</li>
          <li>"git push origin "name of feature branch": this will push up your changes to the remote repository Github.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>"const" keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value, "locks down" what that variable will be, and once declared it can never be reassigned.</li>
          <li>A variable name comes after "const", this name must be unique as it will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>Finally we use an assignment operator "=" to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>A String - includes all of the data for the variable in quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>"console.log" method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>"let" keyword </li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript code runs in cronological order.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements or loops can be used to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An "if" statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. When using "if" statements, code will only execute "if" the statement meets a condition.</li>
          <li>Use "else if" when we want to provide more conditions than just if.</li>
          <li>An Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of related data.</li>
          <li>An Index is the location identified with a unique number in the array, this allows to access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential increasing by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>To access a specific piece of data, we start with the name of the variable that stores the array, then we add the index to the end of the array name in square brackets.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop is used to perform a task on each piece of data, using a few lines of code.</li>
          <li>To use "for" loops we need the shape's index and the array's length, this is important because the "for" loop needs to know how many times the code will run.</li>
          <li>Use "length" to find the length of an array.</li>
          <li>Use "let" keyword to reassign the value of the variable over time.</li>
          <li>We use "let" followed by a unique variable name and the assignment operator "=" to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop contains the following three statements:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>First statement determines a starting point for our loop. ex. "let x = 0"</li>
                <li>Second statement is the condition. ex. "x < shapes.length"</li>
                <li>Final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each time. ex. "x++"</li>
                <li>Lastly, we put the code that we want to be executed for each loop inside curly brackets. ex. "{
                  console.log(shapes[x]);
                 }</li>
                <li>ex. of final code: "for(let x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
                  console.log(shapes[x]);
                 }"</li>
              </ol>
          <li>A "Function" is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. They do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
        </ul>
